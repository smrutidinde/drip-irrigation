Project Description
      The project is to implement the idea of automating the watering phase of gardening using conceal drip irrigation technique to conserve manpower, water and improve the growth, quality and yield of plants.
     The proposed system is an embedded system which will closely monitor and control the various soil parameters of a greenhouse on a regular basis for cultivation of crops or specific plant species or large natural turfs which could maximize their production over the whole crop growth season and to eliminate the difficulties involved in the system by reducing human intervention to the best possible extent. The system comprises of sensors, Analog to Digital Converter, microcontroller and pump.
